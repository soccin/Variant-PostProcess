# Variant-PostProcess (v2)

## This version does not fix the bug with overlapping in/del's in haplotype

New version which assumes main pipeline is running the steps of the previous PostProcessV1

This version starts with the CMO_MAF.txt file created by the BIC pipeline which does all of the SOMATIC and FACETS stuff of version 1 post.

Need to do the following:

* wes-filters

* FILLOUT

* Germline
